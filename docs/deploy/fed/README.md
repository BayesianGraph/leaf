## Networking Multiple Leaf instances
One powerful feature of Leaf is the ability to federate user queries to multiple Leaf instances, even if those using different data models. This enables institutions to securely compare patient populations in a de-identified fashion. An example of this functionality can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuKKC7B8mHI. 

> Networking with other Leaf instances is a **completely optional** functionality. Deploying locally and querying only your institution's data is perfectly fine.
